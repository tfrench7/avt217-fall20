    <h1>About</h1>
      <p>In 1999, a friendly neighborhood gathering spot opened its doors. It was fast, fresh, casual … and fun. We called Pines of Nowhere. The concept was a hit from the first flame. And not too much has changed over the years. Today, Pines of Nowhere is still the place where men and women gather for the big game, co-workers meet for happy hour, families come together, and the Pines’ idea for simple, fresh fare keeps winning over new fans every day.</p>
